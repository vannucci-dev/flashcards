# Flashcards

This project involves using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. Users will be able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users will also be able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.

## Routes

- `/new-topic` – form to create a new topic
- `/topics` – index of all topics
- `/topics/:topicId` – page for an individual topic
- `/new-quiz` – form to create a new quiz
- `/quizzes` – index of all quizzes
- `/quizzes/:quizId` – page for an individual quiz
